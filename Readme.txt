The Fiddle Yard

In this context the Fiddle Yard has to be understood as "Traverser".

The traverser is a moving platform with several parallel model railroad tracks.
A special driver for the traverser is created by Peter Giling (GCA).
Rocrail is able to control the position of the platform in such a way that trains can be moved onto each separate track.

This project is aimed to study the possibility to rearrange trains more or less automatically using a “hill” to move each 
separate car towards a track.
Instead of using Rocrail to control the traverser, an Arduino Nano comes into play.

Several DIY areas need to be touched and further developed.

The main aim of this all is to discover, learn and HAVE FUN!
